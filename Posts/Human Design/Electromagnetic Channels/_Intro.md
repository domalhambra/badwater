### For Newcomers

*If you’ve noticed a solid line connecting two centers on your shared BodyGraph chart, you’ve discovered an **Electromagnetic Channel**. This is where your unique energies combine to create a specialized spark.*

*However, this bond is high-voltage. When aligned, you inspire others by being yourselves. When out of sync, you may feel friction or a repulsion, often due to one person forcing recognition or trying to conform the other’s expression.*

*This “Electromagnetic Channel” series helps you navigate where you might click and where you might find friction, and how to navigate Channels and their Gates. Enjoy!*
